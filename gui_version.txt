1.4.1

Can you believe it has been almost a year since the last update?

Major improvements across the board. The Item Journal has been overhauled to be more efficient and reliable. The bug that wiped journal entries is fixed, and just to be safe, the entire journal backs up every day that you open Mudlet.
