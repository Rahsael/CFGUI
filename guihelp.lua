<white>Variables<gray>

Syntax: <white>var <steel_blue><variable name> <value> <gray>
        <white>var<gray> to see and manage existing variables

<PaleGoldenrod>Variables <gray>are special words that can be set to stand for another for use in <PaleGoldenrod>aliases <gray>(which are detailed in guihelp 2).  For example, you might set the variable @food to 'chicken', or @target to the name of the person you're trying to kill.  This makes your aliases more flexible and multifunctional.

Some of the variables are "default variables," which are recommended and used throughout your interface.  In the bar at the bottom of your screen, you will see six boxes labeled <white>Target, Action, Ally, Aid, Mainhand, <gray>and<white> Offhand.<gray> These are important variables to set, so they're listed in a place where you can always see them.  On the right side of your screen, there is also an alias and variable window, which displays all of your set aliases and variables for your convenience.

If one of your variables refers to an item, we recommend that you use the in-game <white>KEYWORD<gray> command and copy all of the keywords, encased in single-quotes (example: 'whole chicken') into your variable to avoid accidentally using the wrong item.

For a full list of colors, use the <white>showcolors<gray> command.

<PaleGoldenrod>Aliases<gray> are like shortcuts that allow you to enter a complex command by just typing a few letters.  You can make your own using the <white>alias<gray> command, and you can even throw in <PaleGoldenrod>variables<gray> you create using the <white>var<gray> command.<gray>

Examples:
<violet>alias heal co 'heal'
<white>Input:      <PaleGoldenrod>Output:
<white>heal     <OrangeRed>-> <PaleGoldenrod>co 'heal'
<white>heal pal <OrangeRed>-> <PaleGoldenrod>co 'heal' pal

<violet>alias bt bash <steel_blue>@<pale_goldenrod>target
<gray>Set @target or any other variable with the <white>variable<gray> command (i.e. <white>var @target Joe<gray>). If you enter something else after 'bt', your command will replace the @target.

<white>Input:       <PaleGoldenrod>Output:
<white>bt        <OrangeRed>-> <PaleGoldenrod>bash Joe
<white>bt giant  <OrangeRed>-> <PaleGoldenrod>bash giant

<violet>alias aa <steel_blue>@<pale_goldenrod>action <steel_blue>@<pale_goldenrod>target
<gray>(If we set <steel_blue>@<pale_goldenrod>action<gray> to "trip" using: <white>var @action trip<gray>)
<white>Input:       <PaleGoldenrod>Output:
<white>aa        <OrangeRed>-> <PaleGoldenrod>trip Joe
<white>aa giant  <OrangeRed>-> <PaleGoldenrod>trip giant

<violet>alias gc get <MediumSeaGreen># <steel_blue>@<pale_goldenrod>container<OrangeRed>;<violet>eat <MediumSeaGreen>#
<gray>The # character translates into whatever you enter after the pattern. The ; character splits your alias into multiple commands. So, if @container = "knapsack"...
<white>Input:            <PaleGoldenrod>Output:
<white>gc bread       <OrangeRed>-> <PaleGoldenrod>get bread knapsack
                  eat bread

This useful feature might help you remember an enemy's cabal, a warrior's specializations or a shapeshifter's forms. On the WHO and WHERE lists, names of friends will be tinted blue, while enemies' will be tinted red.

The Item Journal is an automatic feature that automatically logs and stores every item that you identify.

<white>t3 <steel_blue><name><gray>

<gray>Each of these commands adds an alternate target to buttons at the top of your interface. The <white>t1<gray> command sets a name that will become your <white>Target<gray> when you press the F1 key or click the button. The <white>t2<gray> command corresponds to your F2 key, and so on.

<gray>For example: Edward is your Target, and Jacob is your t1 alternate target. You press F1 or click on Jacob's name. Jacob then becomes your Target.
	
The <white>a5, a6, and a7<gray> commands can be used to add alternate actions to the buttons at the top of your interface.

<gray>Examples: <white>log cabalraid<gray>

The <white>autolog<gray> command toggles automatic logging of each and every session.  Those raw logs go into the log folder and are named using a date and time code.

<gray>You can also use the <white>log<gray> command to start a separate log. If you enter a filename that doesn't exist, it will create it as a text file in the log folder, which can be easily accessed by clicking the 'Logs' button at the top right corner of the screen. Use <white>log off<gray> to stop logging. The <white>searchlog<gray> command will find instances of a word or set of words in a log.

<gray>This quick logging function was contributed by a member of the Mudlet community. If you want to create more robust logs, you may use Mudlet's stock logging or replay features, located in the row of buttons to the right of the input prompt.

<white>Mapping<gray>

<gray>The Mudlet generic mapper works with Carrion Fields. We've added a few tweaks with this skin that should help your mapping efforts considerably.

You can create your own maps of areas that you can save and use across multiple characters. However, we ask that you respect the rules and not share secrets and especially do not share maps of Explore Areas.  Rule violations can result in character denials or even sitebans.

To get started mapping, use the <white>map basics<gray> command.

<gray>Additionally, you can click the <white>World Map<gray> button to see an artistic rendering of the overworld, and the <white>Wiki Maps<gray> button to travel to an external website with text-based maps that are updated often by players.

<white>Advanced Aliases & Scripting<gray>
  
<gray>We offer two ways to make aliases in Mudlet: our simple, command-line system, and the Mudlet way, which involves Lua scripting.  If you decide to go the advanced route, knowing some basic programming helps. For the brave, visit wiki.mudlet.org for a helpful guide on creating aliases from scratch in Mudlet.

<orange_red>* <gray>To get started making simple ones, it's as easy as typing <white>alias<gray>.  This is what we recommend for the vast majority of players. <orange_red>*<gray>

<orange_red>*<gray> Do not put your unique aliases in the CFGUI folder, or they will be lost when you update the Carrion Fields skin. <orange_red>*<gray>

<white>Troubleshooting<gray>
  
<gray>Many issues with the GUI can be fixed by entering SCORE or AFF in-game. On rare occasions, you may need to use the setprompt command again. If something seems hopelessly broken, try restarting Mudlet. If that fails, try creating a new profile and reloading this package. If you have further questions, comments or suggestions, please email rahsael@carrionfields.com and I'll do my best to help you out. If you're having trouble with an alias or some other type of customization, and copying/modifying an existing one isn't cutting it, check out Mudlet's wiki and forums - they do a great job and the community there is extremely supportive.
